# gender-age-estimation-mxnet-cpp

you should see also my the other [repository](https://github.com/ZHEQIUSHUI/Retinaface-Cpp-mxnet),

this repository is base on that

there are two methods(GenderAgePredict*.h) to estimation the face gender and age

[GenderAgePredict.h](https://github.com/ZHEQIUSHUI/gender-age-estimation-mxnet-cpp/blob/master/GenderAgePredict.h) is better in gender estimation

[GenderAgePredict_othermethod.h](https://github.com/ZHEQIUSHUI/gender-age-estimation-mxnet-cpp/blob/master/GenderAgePredict_othermethod.h) is better in age estimation

but...the gender-estimation is low accurry both that,maybe the reason is i have not did alignment face,cause i was failed...
